# ClipboardBuddy
A lightweight, open-source java applet, meant to supercharge your clipboard experience with configurable search and replace rules.
## Features
- Regex based *Search and Replace* system for modifying your clipboard automatically upon copying
- Configuration is file based, and easy to share
- Automation is toggleable, when necessary
- Clipboard history is preserved locally while app is running
## About
ClipboardBuddy is an extension of the idea conceived in my [TwitterFxAdder](https://github.com/dylan-park/TwitterFxAdder) project. That project was only created to solve a very specific niche problem I was facing, but I realized the concept is pretty easily expanded into a much more fleshed out system.

The primary use-cases I see from this project include (but are not limited to):
- Removing tracking/affiliate query strings from known URLs
- Modifying links from Twitter, YouTube, etc, to utilize web services that better display their content (like TwitFix)
- Redacting known common information from your clipboard
- Managing a local history of clipboard items
